# Sophie Germain Pairs (n, 2n+1)

$N = 1,000,000,000$ (odd n only)

| Population | Mean ω(2n+1) | Sample size |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| n prime | 3.0827 | 50,847,533 |
| n composite | 2.8107 | 449,152,466 |
| **Difference** | **0.2720** | — |

Predicted: Σ 1/[q(q-1)] for q ≥ 3 = 0.2730

Relative error: 0.37%

Note: Restricted to odd n for fair comparison. Even n are never prime
(except n=2), so including them contaminates the composite baseline.
